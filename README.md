Eggertron's Open GL wrapper for C<br>
Want to make a simple wrapper to build Open GL apps in C<br>
I got used to the way Processing handles graphics, so I decided<br>
to start working on a wrapper that is similar to Processing.<br>
<br>
create your .c file and include ogl.c<br>
since ogl.c already has a main function, you must not<br>
define a main.<br>
setup() and draw() MUST be implemented.<br>
Will work on a better resource page, I will make it as similar to<br>
Processing as possible.<br>
